Automated Network Scanner with Advanced Nmap Integration
This project is a Python-based network scanning tool that leverages Nmap to perform automated scans on specified targets. The tool supports multiple scan types, including basic, advanced, and stealth scans, and generates a detailed report of the scan results in a plain text file.

Features
Basic Scan: Performs a standard SYN scan to identify open ports and services on the target.
Advanced Scan: Includes version detection, OS detection, and additional scan techniques to gather more detailed information about the target.
Stealth Scan: Utilizes techniques to evade IDS and firewalls, such as packet fragmentation, decoys, randomized host order, and source port manipulation.
Text Report Generation: The tool generates a neatly formatted report in a plain text file, summarizing the results of the scan, including information on hosts, ports, protocols, services, and products.



Usage

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-network-scanner.git
cd automated-network-scanner

Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Script: You can specify the type of scan (basic, advanced, or stealth) and the output file for the results:
python script.py <target> -s <scan_type> -o <output_file>

Example:
python script.py 192.168.1.1 -s stealth -o results.txt
View the Results: The results will be saved to the specified output file (e.g., results.txt). The file will contain detailed information about the scanned hosts, including open ports, services, protocols, and more.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Nmap
Jinja2 (for text report formatting)













Run the script with the desired options:

python myproject.py <target> -s <scan_type> -o <output_file>
